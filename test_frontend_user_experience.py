    Breaking News: Scientists at MIT have developed a revolutionary new battery technology 
    that could charge electric vehicles in just 30 seconds. The breakthrough involves using 
    a new type of lithium-metal battery with a special coating that prevents dangerous 
    dendrite formation. This technology could solve one of the biggest barriers to electric 
    vehicle adoption - long charging times. The research team, led by Dr. Sarah Chen, 
    published their findings in Nature Energy journal. The new batteries can handle over 
    10,000 charge cycles without significant degradation, far exceeding current battery 
    technology. Major automotive companies including Tesla, Ford, and Toyota have already 
    expressed interest in licensing this technology. Commercial applications could be 
    available within 3-5 years if testing continues to show positive results.
